📘 Project Specification Report
Project Name: IntentBoard
An Intent‑Driven Generative Analytics Layer for Existing Business Databases

1. Executive Summary
Modern businesses store vast amounts of data in relational and document databases, yet extracting insights from this data remains slow, technical, and fragmented. Traditional BI tools require manual dashboard creation, SQL expertise, and constant maintenance, creating a dependency on data teams and limiting insight velocity.

IntentBoard solves this problem by acting as a plug‑and‑play AI interface on top of existing databases. By securely connecting to a company’s current data sources and leveraging Generative UI (GenUI) powered by Tambo SDK and Model Context Protocol (MCP), IntentBoard allows users to explore, analyze, and visualize data using natural language, without writing SQL or building dashboards manually.

The system dynamically generates UI components (charts, tables, summaries) based on user intent while strictly enforcing data access permissions and query safety.

2. Problem Statement
2.1 Current Challenges
Business data lives in MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, but access requires:

SQL knowledge

BI tooling expertise

Manual dashboard design

Existing BI tools:

Have steep learning curves

Are static and slow to adapt

Create analyst bottlenecks

AI chat tools:

Lack secure, structured data access

Cannot maintain persistent UI state

Are unsafe when directly connected to databases

2.2 Opportunity
There is a clear gap for a system that:

Works directly on existing databases

Requires zero data migration

Converts user intent → safe queries → dynamic UI

Is secure, auditable, and enterprise‑ready

3. Project Objectives
Primary Objectives
Enable users to connect their existing databases securely

Allow fine‑grained authorization of AI access to data

Support natural‑language analytics and exploration

Generate dynamic, persistent dashboards via Generative UI

Maintain strict safety and permission boundaries

Secondary Objectives

📘 SRS Update — Frontend Component System (shadcn/ui)
1. Revision Summary
This update amends the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) to formally include shadcn/ui as the standardized frontend component library used in the system, in conjunction with Tailwind CSS and Tambo SDK.

2. Updated Technology Stack (SRS Section)
2.1 Frontend Technology Stack
Layer	Technology
Framework	React (Next.js App Router)
Language	TypeScript
Styling	Tailwind CSS
Component System	shadcn/ui
Generative UI Orchestration	Tambo SDK
Schema Validation	Zod
3. Frontend Architecture Requirements (Updated)
3.1 Component System Requirements
FR-FE-01
The system shall use shadcn/ui as the primary source of reusable frontend UI components.

FR-FE-02
All visual UI elements rendered by the application—including buttons, dialogs, cards, tables, inputs, dropdowns, and modals—shall be composed using shadcn/ui components styled with Tailwind CSS.

FR-FE-03
shadcn/ui components shall serve as the base building blocks for all AI‑generated (Generative UI) components registered with the Tambo SDK.

4. Generative UI Integration Requirements (Updated)
4.1 BYOC (Bring Your Own Component) Compliance
FR-GEN-01
All components registered with Tambo for Generative UI rendering shall be:

Implemented as React components

Built using shadcn/ui primitives

Styled exclusively via Tailwind CSS

Validated via Zod schemas

FR-GEN-02
The AI system shall never generate raw HTML, CSS, or JSX.
Instead, it shall invoke pre‑built shadcn/ui‑based React components through Tambo’s tool invocation mechanism.

5. Design System & Consistency Requirements
NFR-UI-01
The system shall enforce visual consistency by ensuring all AI‑generated UI conforms to the shadcn/ui design system.

NFR-UI-02
Theme configuration (colors, typography, spacing) shall be centrally managed through Tailwind and shadcn/ui tokens, ensuring brand consistency across all generated dashboards.

NFR-UI-03
AI‑generated interfaces shall not introduce new visual patterns outside the approved shadcn/ui component set.

6. Accessibility & Usability Requirements
NFR-A11Y-01
All frontend components shall inherit shadcn/ui’s accessibility defaults, including:

ARIA attributes

Keyboard navigation

Focus management

NFR-A11Y-02
AI‑generated UI components must maintain accessibility compliance by construction, as they are composed from accessible shadcn/ui primitives.

7. Rationale (SRS Justification)
shadcn/ui is selected as the frontend component system because it:

Aligns with modern React and Tailwind best practices

Enables deterministic, reusable UI components

Is compatible with Tambo’s BYOC (Bring Your Own Component) model

Prevents design drift in AI‑generated interfaces

Supports enterprise‑grade accessibility and theming

This choice ensures that Generative UI remains safe, consistent, and production‑ready, even when dynamically assembled by an AI agent.

8. Impact Summary
Area	Impact
UI Consistency	Improved
AI Safety	Strengthened
Design System Enforcement	Guaranteed
Developer Velocity	Increased
Hackathon Readiness	High
